# cake-video-plugin
This is a plugin created for CakePHP V.3.

This plugin can be used to create a video page with a regex search filter, categories, and easy video linking. It would be good in a situation where you have videos on Vimeo but want to easily present/filter them on your own video page. It should be relatively easy to install.

It uses Bootstrap, so it is responsive and mobile compatible. See screenshots below.

My languages and plugins: HTML5, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery, and Bootstrap. Note: Only the views, controllers, and custom css exist here. If you would like to use this plugin, you will need install the necessary Bootstrap and JavaScript/jQuery files and go to http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/plugins.html to learn how to install plugins.

Enjoy!
